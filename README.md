# Purple-Slime-s-5th-Edition-Character-Menu
This Project allows the user to create a D&D character while requiring minimal input from the user themselves. The 

Please download the PurpleSlime'sCharacterMenu.Jar File to view the program itself.

Additionally, Dowload The User Manual, as it will explain all information needed to use the program itself while also illustrating aspects of character creation.

I have also uploaded the Requirements Documentation, Design Documentation, as well as the UI.java file. 
I included the UI.java file to demonstrate my coding practices and formatting, as this portion of the code was primarilly written by myself with some additions to interface
with code written by my project collaborators being written by said collaborators.

Note: This project was created by a team of three people. I was responsible for many aspects of the project but the user interface was almost entirely my effort and therefore is the best example of my personal coding structure and formatting. 

Please also note that this program is designed to be used with a 5th edition D&D Player's Handbook or with the SRD.
